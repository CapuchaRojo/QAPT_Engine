QATP_X = "Quantum ATP Energy Framework - Bio-Inspired Quantum AI System"

This script expands upon the original QATP Engine concept, incorporating advanced quantum energy mechanisms
such as exciton transport chains, polaritonic condensates, and quantum batteries.

Original Concept:
- Quantum Condensate State Simulation (using qutip)
- Light Energy Transfer Efficiency (modeled as a simple function)
This version extends the concept into a full bio-inspired quantum AI processing system.

The original approach (using qutip for state representation) can still be used for specific quantum simulations, 
but the new system introduces a broader framework for AI energy transfer.

# QATP-X: Quantum ATP Energy Framework - Bio-Inspired Quantum AI System

This script defines the QATP-X system with a bio-inspired quantum energy framework.
It mimics biological energy processes (like mitochondrial electron transport and photosynthetic exciton transfer)
to achieve efficient energy usage in AI computations.

Components:
- QuantumExcitonTransportChain: transports energy via excitons (inspired by electron transport chain).
- PolaritonCondensate: stores energy in a quantum condensate (exciton-polariton Bose–Einstein condensate).
- NQPU (Neural Quantum Processing Unit): processes data using quantum effects (tunneling, coherence) for AI tasks.
- QuantumBattery: stores and provides energy using quantum states, with resonant coupling for transfer.
- QATPSystem: orchestrates the above components and integrates with classical processing (hybrid quantum-classical).

The design is modular and extensible. Each component can be further developed or connected to real quantum simulation tools.
