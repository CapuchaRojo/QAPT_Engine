QATP-X
The Quantum AI Energy Transfer Processor (QATP-X) is an innovative project aimed at developing a self-sustaining AI computation system. Inspired by biological mitochondria, QATP-X leverages quantum condensation principles and light-based energy transfer to eliminate the dependency on traditional electrical power, creating a continuous, low-energy computational loop.​
